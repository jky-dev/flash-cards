# FlashCards

## About

FlashCards (OptomCards) is a flash card web app, used as a study tool for 5th year UNSW optometry students. Questions are written and edited in a Google Sheet document that automatically updates a Firebase realtime database. Users are able to log in to save their progress of the questions they have gotten correctly, as well as save their preferences and select categories of what questions they do not want to be tested on.
